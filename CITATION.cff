abstract: >
  SpaX is a Python library that makes it easy to define, explore, visualize, and
  optimize search spaces for machine-learning workflowsâ€”covering hyperparameter
  tuning and architecture choices. It provides a declarative Config API (built on
  Pydantic v2), conditional parameters, random and Optuna-backed sampling,
  serialization (JSON/YAML/TOML), and an override system for iterative pruning
  and expansion of spaces.
